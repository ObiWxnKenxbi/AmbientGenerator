# AmbientGenerator
The Ambient Generator is a Pure Data patch comprised of a granular control system, which allows users to select from pre-loaded samples of
simple vocalizations or upload their own samples. The user has the ability to adjust various parameters such as
offset, randomness, pitch, grain size, density, panning, and chance of the grain, as well as the ability to autoplay
the sample at varying speeds and to freeze it. Additionally, the patch includes a visual representation of
the grain location, further enhancing the user experience. To complement the granular control system, a preset
reverb effect is included to create an even more ambient sound. The second part of the patch is composed of
random ambient background sounds, including a patch that generates random sounds from two chords, as well
as pre-loaded samples of a kick, snare and cymbal/gong, to recreate a classic TR-808 sound.
