# AmbientGenerator
The ambient Generator patch comprises a granular control system and random ambient background sounds, including a patch that generates random sounds from two chords, as well as pre-loaded samples of a kick, snare, and cymbal/gong, to recreate a classic TR-808 sound.

Here is the youtube video of the demostration: https://youtu.be/LK4_Kl8M_mU
